00:00:02 hi guys today I'm gonna teach you how to
00:00:05 deploy react app in two minutes
00:00:08 so first of all this is a simple react
00:00:10 app which is made in the node.js react
00:00:13 mongodb
00:00:14 I will share the code Link in the
00:00:18 below section you can access from there
00:00:19 so once your app development is complete
00:00:23 the two step we have to do only
00:00:25 first we'll make a build of this
00:00:27 application now to make a build of the
00:00:29 application
00:00:30 just open your application folder and
00:00:33 run very very simple command just write
00:00:36 npm run build
00:00:38 when you build it it will generate the
00:00:41 build of this application
00:00:43 in the meanwhile the build is getting
00:00:45 generated just sign up over the website
00:00:48 called netlify.com
00:00:50 I will share the link of this website
00:00:52 also in the description section
00:00:55 now from here once the build is ready a
00:00:58 very simple step to do on this
00:01:00 particular website you will find one
00:01:02 option drag and drop a website
00:01:05 so we'll drag it our build folder to
00:01:07 this location and application is ready
00:01:10 to use
00:01:16 so now my ability you can see here the
00:01:19 build is there in my folder so if we
00:01:22 access that folder you will see the
00:01:24 build
00:01:25 so this is the react build now I'll
00:01:28 simply drag this build at this location
00:01:31 and you are good to go
00:01:33 so your application is ready to use
00:01:36 after deployment complete and then we
00:01:39 can use the URL so this is the
00:01:41 production URL is open a URL an app is
00:01:45 ready to use all the name is there you
00:01:47 can change the name of the application
00:01:48 go to site overview
00:01:51 website configuration
00:01:53 and then the multiple options are there
00:01:55 chain site name change the name of site
00:01:58 I'll set developer funnel
00:02:02 I'll save it and then you are good to go
00:02:07 your app is ready
00:02:08 thank you
